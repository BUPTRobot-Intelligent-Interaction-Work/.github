# About Us 🌟

Welcome to the repository of **Group 5**, from the **AI Interaction Robot Experiment Course** at the Artificial Intelligence Institute during the second semester of 2023! 🎓 This is where we share our work, code, and insights from the course.

## 🛠️ What We Do  
During this course, we completed several exciting projects, including:

- **Webots OP2 Robot Simulation** 🤖  
- **Ginger Robot Simulation in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4)** 🎮  
- **Ginger Robot Real-world Experiments**:  
  - **Language Understanding and Q&A** 💬  
  - **Autonomous Navigation** 🧭  
  - **Target Recognition and Response** 🎯

## Challenges and Current Status 💡  
Unfortunately, due to collaboration issues between the university and the company Dattabot, the Ginger robot is no longer functional on campus. As a result, development involving its RDK (Robot Development Kit) has been discontinued.  

However, many **general-purpose technical applications** from our work remain valuable! These include:  
- **Rasa Framework for Dialogue Systems** 🗨️  
- **YOLOv5 for Object Detection** 📷  
- **Sentence Intent Recognition** 🔍  

These resources can serve as references for your own technical journey.
